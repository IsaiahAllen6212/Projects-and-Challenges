Hello!

Every coding challenge and project that I have done after graduation, I have put the code into the folders above.
Each Challenge I have done, I have done in Python, C++, and Java.
My Projects are all chosen with the idea that it would challenge me and make me a better engineer.

NOTE: The "Runtime" in some of my challeneges are marked as '0ms'. This may be due to running it on Leetcode. So, take that with a grain of salt.
